Building safe, decent, and affordable housing in partnership with the community and God’s people in need.

About Clay County Habitat for Humanity

Clay County Habitat for Humanity is a nonprofit, ecumenical Christian housing ministry dedicated to eliminating substandard housing in Clay County area (Penney Farms, Green Cove Springs, Middleburg, Orange Park, Keystone Heights). As an affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International, we work in partnership with local families and volunteers to build safe, decent, and affordable homes for low-income individuals and families in need.

All are welcome

Clay County Habitat is an equal housing opportunity nonprofit. We do not discriminate against any person or family based on their race, color, religion, sex, age, handicap, family status, national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity.

As a matter of policy, Habitat for Humanity International and its affiliated organizations do not proselytize. This means that Habitat will not offer assistance on the expressed or implied condition that people must either adhere to or convert to a particular faith or listen and respond to messaging designed to induce conversion to a particular faith.

Habitat for Humanity International Vision

A world where everyone has a decent place to live.

Habitat for Humanity International Mission Statement

Seeking to put God’s love into action, Habitat for Humanity brings people together to build homes, communities and hope.

About Habitat for Humanity International

Founded in Americus, Georgia, USA, in 1976, Habitat for Humanity today operates around the globe. In 2023, Habitat for Humanity helped 13.4 million people build or improve a place to call home.
